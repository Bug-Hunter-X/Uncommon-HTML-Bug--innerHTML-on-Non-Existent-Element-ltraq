This repository demonstrates a subtle yet crucial bug in HTML involving the `innerHTML` property.  The `bug.html` file showcases the incorrect usage of `innerHTML` on a non-existent element, leading to a silent failure.  The script attempts to modify a non-existent element's `innerHTML`, which doesn't throw an error but also doesn't produce any visible change. The `bugSolution.html` provides the correct implementation by ensuring that the element exists before modifying its `innerHTML`.
